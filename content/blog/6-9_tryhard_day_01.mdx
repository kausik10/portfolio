<p>Today is the first day of 6-9 tryhard challenge.</p>

<p>
  I woke up at 5:30 a.m. and went on a walk to Subarneshor temple. There were
  many people visiting the area for morning walks. I was a little exhausted
  climbing up the hill as it had been more than a month since I went on a walk.
  I returned home at 6:15 and practiced guided breathing by Wim Hof. I had my
  breakfast at 7.

  I spent the next couple of hours watching Valorant on youtube while setting up
  Node JS in my laptop for Javascript development. I had my lunch at 10. I
  watched the popular series ‘The Boys’ Season 2 for the next 4 hours. At about
  3pm I did my workout sessions. Today was push day and I couldn’t do push ups
  as I had expected. Let’s say, the performance was very bad. Nonetheless, I
  completed my abs and push routine at 4 and had my post workout meal. After
  that, I took a shower and washed dirty clothes. At about 6, I set up my laptop
  to learn Javascript.
</p>

<p>
  It had been ages since I had not coded in JS, so I looked up some tutorials to
  recall fundamentals of JS. I learned about dynamic typing, variables and data
  types; innate and derived . I also learned about the fundamentals of objects
  and functions in Javascript. I used nodejs to run my javascript code in the
  terminal which was really awesome.

  Before sleeping today, I plan to read 10 pages of a popular book, ‘The
  Psychology of Money’ and drink some water. Overall, DAY_01 has been very
  relaxing and I enjoyed it a lot today. I look forward to spending tomorrow
  with the same enthusiasm as I have today. Remember to take one step at a time.
  Good night !
