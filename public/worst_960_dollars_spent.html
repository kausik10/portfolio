    “As a Computer Engineering student, laptop is the most essential device.”

    Back me off here guys! I know everyone would agree with me here. 
 </p>
 <p>
    On December 2021, I took one of the most important decisions for upcoming 5 years. I bought a laptop for pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering. I searched the internet for the best laptop suitable for my price range and capable of doing things that I wanted during my ‘university era’.
 </p>
 <p>
    My budget: <em>$970</em>
 </p>
 <p>
    I chose: <em>ASUS TUF F15 2021 model</em>
 </p>
 <p>
    Why? It was slim, sleek and the display was amazing!
 </p>
 <p>
    Let me list out the specs for you.

        These were some of the major highlights of the laptop I had bought.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a Backlit keyboard, a 6000 DPI mouse, I was on heaven playing games the first few weeks. I was happy with my laptop. Until something went terribly wrong!
    </p>
    <p><em>What went Wrong?</em></p>
    <p>
        6 months in, my laptop started freezing abruptly. At first, the audio was distorted (like a disturbed radio message on sci-fi films). Then the wifi disappeared. And I could do nothing. My only option was to force shutdown the laptop and reboot again.
